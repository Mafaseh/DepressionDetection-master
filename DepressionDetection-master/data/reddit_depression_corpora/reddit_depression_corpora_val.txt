"God I feel so shitty constantly. Like I have not been happy in months. I tried to share how I was feeling with a couple friends, and we are not friends anymore because I am depressing to be around. The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself is I did not want to fail and end up paralyzed or brain damaged or in a mental hospital.Life is just so shit. I had to do a gun safety course to be allowed to buy a gun, but I finally got in and passed it and now I can buy a shotgun. I cannot wait to be out of this absolute fucking shithole of a planet.The worst part of depression is I know nobody else can help me, and I am too far gone to help myself. I have tried what I could. I am basically a walking pharmacy, I have been to therapy, I have talked to family. Nothing actually helps at all.Anyways I guess I just wanted to get that off my chest. I think I will finally be able to do it."
Hey people . I think I need help. For a years I have had mood swings but never this radical . I go to ok to planning to kill myself and I do not know what to do. Every little mistake bring me down like it is the end of the world. I cannot get a raise at my job because of this. I do love my job and some aspects of my life. I saw a psy it did not really help and I take pills so I am confused and exhausted mentally Radical Mood swings
"Today is my birthday and it feels extra shitty. In my head I am just thinking to myself, maybe today is my last bday. it is supposed to feel like a special day but why do I feel so lonely and sad....I think to myself, I did great, I struggled long enough and maybe it is just time to relax and end everything. Today is my birthday"
"I work on myself obsessively, like I am genuinely obsessed with self improvement. Without thinking, though, I act like a total bastard and people get hurt and I have to pick up the pieces and apologize again for who I am. This is not a suicide note or anything, it is just something that always comes up when I am having suicidal episodes. I want to be a better person, but it sometimes feels impossible. I am an asshole and I am constantly frustrated with the way I treat myself and other people"
"it is my birthday today and I did not think I would make it to this day. Truly. This year fucking sucks so far, man.I lost most of my friends, I have memory loss, I have been suicidal since pretty much the start of this year and I was certain that I would kill myself before my birthday.But I am still alive and present. Broken, but present. Happy birthday to me I guess."
"One day I just want to get a knife and cut and cut and cut my arm apart. I just want to see the blood that will leak out, the numbness with slight pain afterwards. While my consciousness will finally rest and be at peace and I can leave this world I want to rip my arms apart"
"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student"
"I sometimes feel that dying by an airplane crash or snake bite would be better off when compared to say suicide, because of the sympathy it would generate. Am I the only person romanticising this? Am I the only person romanticising dying by an airplane crash or snake bite?"
I try helping a friend out course he was very depressed .but I tried my best Suicide was never and option
"I am having trouble sleeping so I thought I would just vent hereI just graduated from junior college, and now have to serve a compulsory 2 years in the army. So now is the time for me to think about what I want to study in universityJunior College really burned me out, and I do not feel really passionate about anything other than comics and film. I have tried to reignite an interest in coding, but I just feel so uninterested and defeated.The reason why I particularly like film is because you get to create content in our increasingly consumerism-centric society. I also want to work on comic adaptations, because I just love these storiesMany people in life, they encourage you to chase your passion, and I want to, but I feel like work experience is much more useful to get myself into the film industry. I seriously have little faith in the film school route, what if I spend 3-5 years getting a film degree and still struggling to find a job, especially in my country where the film industry is tinyAlso, since the film industry here is so tiny, coming across opportunities to work in the film industry after my 2 years of army service...seems hardI just feel so empty. My only real passion in life now is comics and film. I do not have that many friends to share joy withAnd I am just sad I feel empty, not very interested in almost all career options. Only really interested in film. Yeah."
"Has anyone been institutionalised for depression? I am struggling a lot, and fear for my life, but getting hospitalised scares me so much, I feel I would only feel worse and more of a failure after it. Can anyone share some insight? What is it like to get institutionalised?"
"This is my final attempt at life, I cannot go on no longer. I can feel it, I only have a few days before I take my life. I am not Gods strongest warrior. I cannot bear the tests He is giving me. I tried so hard to be the person she wanted me to be. But its so hard for me to change and I drove her away. I know it may not seem like much but 8 months and a day after we were done she said she is ready to move on. Did she even love me. I drove around in a frantic craze trying to find an open therapy spot but its Sunday and nothing is open. Its currently 10:29 PM today and I can feel my life-force draining slowly. I am at my wits end. Someone please save me. The only reason I have not taken my own life is because according to the bible, people who take their own life go to hell. But i do not want to go to hell. I just want the pain to stop. I have been hurt so much by my stupid actions and I put the last of my energy into this relationship. She promised that she would not leave, and would stay by my side to try and better myself. Did she love me. The voices are getting louder and I cannot control it. It seems to spiral at nighttime when I am alone. I do not like sleeping alone all I could remember is cuddling with her. Why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why WHAT IS IS WRNG WITH ME. I cannot TAKE IT ANYMORE SOMEONE SAVE ME PLEASE My Last Cry for Help @ Life"
"This is something I have done my whole life but I guess I never really put it together. What does it mean exactly to attempt suicide? Like for me, I have written a suicide note, grabbed a knife, put it against my heart and tried to push it in but I could not. I was too scared that I would fail. Similarly, I have done this with pills, hanging, suffocating. Ultimately I just chickened out because I was afraid I would fail and survive it. Then I would cry and hate myself because I felt like a failure that I could not complete it. Anyway, I guess I have always doubted the legitimacy of the things I say to myself or believe. I just never knew if these were actually considered suicide attempts. Every time I try to look it up I just get that stupid fucking link to the suicide hotline. Anyway, thanks. If I tried to kill myself but got too scared to go through with it, is that considered a suicide attempt?"
"we have grown up together and are very close, we now live in an apartment just the two of us and I suffer with depression but hers is worse. I get frustrated sometimes because she does not do house things but I understand. How do I help her get better? My sister is deeply depressed and I have no idea how to help"
i feel like I am veering of the deep end. again. this is the 5th time this month. can i talk to someone
"I do not know if some of you remember me, but I did a post a few days back here -&gt; [Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?]( summarized now all the symptoms you have written down in the comment section. Why I do it is because for years I was beating myself up for those less obvious symptoms, because I was not aware that it goes hand in hand with depression and thought I was simply mentally and emotionally weak, compared to everybody else. Since I had this epiphany that it might be directly associated to depression, I understand my mind much better, which I find to be helpful for myself. This leads me to have more compassion for myself and knowing, that this is not necessarily who I am. It has often been pointless trying to solve those problems (which I was trying to do for years), because as long as I am/was depressed, there was literally *nothing* I could do about those less obvious symptoms. it is like working hard for having no results, and then hating myself for not making any progress at all. So I hoped to help some of the people here too.Disclaimer:This list does not serve to be self-diagnosed and many of the points do not have to have anything to do with depression.Again: these are the LESS OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS. So for example sadness, exhaustion, numbness or lack of appetite are not listed, since those would be the better-known symptoms.&amp;#x200B;COGNITIVE ABILITIES* Memory loss * Reduced focus capacity* Problems with learning * Catatonia * Less intelligent* Inability to read* Derealization / Dissociation* Negative change in executive functioning EMOTIONS + FEELINGS* Indecisiveness (even for the smallest and less important decisions) * Shame / feeling embarrassed* Guilt* Bitterness* Irritation / anger* Anxiety* Impulsiveness * Frozen (emotionally, mentally and physically)* Restless * Overwhelmed by the smallest things (emotionally, mentally and physically) SELF IMAGE* Low self-esteem * Self-loathing* Everything is my fault* Loss of identity * Fixating on physical appearance * Consistent and relentless negative self talk* Self-doubt* Imposter-syndrome PHYSICAL* Sexual impotence / asexual / very low libido* Insomnia / sleeping issues / sleep deprivation* Lack of hygiene * Losing sense of taste* Gastrointestinal symptoms * Physical aches * Physical discomfort * Headaches / Feeling like an anchor pushes on your head * Sensitive to noises * Acne, hair loss, lower back pain &amp; irregular periods (&lt;- this could be symptoms of something else, e.g. hormonal) SOCIAL* Lower social intelligence * Not being able to handle criticism * Sensitivity to rejection* Grudge holding* Decreased ability to read social ques or properly display emotions * The need for company + not having energy to be social* Wanting people to know(or notice) that you are depressed / the need for compassion* Envy of people * Not wanting to be a burden to others isolating* Hating people / misanthropy * Being rude to others OTHERS* Burnout * Overthinking* Complaining* Remember all childhood experiences and overanalyzing them * Identifying with depressed famous people and romanticizing own situation and wanting to put own negative thoughts into artwork* Never being in the moment* Not caring about the future* Exaggeration of own bad situation Comprehensive list of the less obvious symptoms of depression"
"I used to cry every single day. But now, my self esteem is higher and I am actually kind of enjoying life a lot more. However, i still lack motivation to do the things i love or get out of the house. I do not feel sad anymore, i just lack motivation"
"I have been through too much shit to list, but the most important thing is I have binge eating disorder that has gained me 70 pounds which makes me want to kill myself, and I feel zero pleasure from literally anything and have not for years. I used heroin for 20 days straight (no longer using) to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days, and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged. This means no leaving my room, interacting etc for a week at least, and I have two very important family things I am canceling in a few minutes. How do I get my family to push me to suicide? I cannot do it on my own. How do I make them push me to finally do it?"
"Id like to say that I have lived a pretty normal life, nothing is really depressing about my life except how I perceive my own life. I have been diagnosed as having an anxiety disorder, so its really hard to just reach out to others because of constant overthinking, and I was also diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. I am 20 years old and in my high school years I have always constantly thought about killing myself just because I feel like a waste of a body a waste a space and a complete disappointment to my mother. I tried going to therapy genuinely looking for help and all I got was Zoloft. While still on Zoloft I still felt the same and for some reason in my senior year I completely stopped going to school and ended up dropping out, mom was not too proud of that. All I did all day was play video games smoke weed and work at a fast food restaurant. I actually started dating a girl for about 9 months which is my longest relationship but about 5 months ago she broke up with me which was okay I knew I would get over it but she started telling everyone and persistently posted saying I raped her throughout our entire relationship which completely caught me by surprise we got into an argument and the posting became consistent and most of the people I actually loved all see me as a monster that destroyed an innocent girl. I have contemplated suicide so often it no longer makes me sad and I am trying to find the absolute easiest and painless method on doing so. I guess I just need some help with this whole situation because I do not know what to do I get a good amount of threats I have already told the police of the situation I am just lost and I only see one way out. I want to die"
"Way to add stress to a stressful situation, assholes. HEY MODS STOP DELETING MY POSTS WITH NO EXPLANATION"
I am m21 my mother passed away 3 days ago she was a single mother my rock a fucking saint I loved her man. Today I loose it at work because a customer tells me I am being very abrupt with her so I snap shouting at her I got fired. And to make matters worse my girlfriend who is been with me since we were 14 has decide that this week is the perfect time to tell me does not have feelings for me anymore I mean what did I do wrong man I tried to be there for her and now she is gone the last thing that would have kept me goijng I just do not see a point in going on man what is the point I just loose orfuck up everything man I am just so tired of the pain I am do not know how much longer I can go on. Man
"I feel like nothing everyday, I wake up and ask why am I alive and why did not I die in my sleep? I mean almost nothing to most members but of society so if I offd myself people would forget about me after using my name for publicity after 3 days.When you die people only care then use your name for clout.Tired of living a life I did not ask for, I have no goals, no motivation. I live in a bum ass town encompassed in a shitty county with no opportunities. People tell me no excuses but, I do not care I am not as strong as everybody. And being a man they expect you to suck it up and hold it in. But in reality I just rather off myself or die in my sleep. On the edge and probably about to write my final note."
"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort, not cops"
"I have ruined myself and my body, I allowed a under qualified surgeon to operate on me and she butchered me. Not to mention This is not the first time I have had trauma and had to suffer so badly. Everyone says I am fine and this will pass but I just want to go back in time and never let her operate on me, I just want my old body back. I am so close to ending it, I just want to stop waking up and having panic attacks, crying all the time and end the suffering once and for all. I am so close to ending it"
"This place is hell and I am being punished so all pain and suffering experienced is justified I guessmaybe if I convince myself hard enough that will actually become my realitysomething anything to fill the hole. Its all too painfully empty, I cannot even hate it. I cannot do anything but distract myself.I miss that kid There is no answer"
its safe to say I have been really depressed lately (its usually more of episodes followed by feeling okay followed by another episode for me) and I cannot stop thinking my bf has fallen out of love or I am not good enough etc. and its causing me to want to just. cuddle him constantly or be with him most the time and I can tell its getting on his nerves and I do not want to be like that lol (we live together and both 20years old) can depression make me act clingy??
I am 38 years and I have wanted to die ever since I was a teenager. I have never been happy no matter what had gone on in my life. I have always been miserable and wanted to die. I have not killed myself because of my mother. I did not want her to go through the pain of losing me so I went through the pain of living for over 20 years. Now I do not have to worry about hurting her anymore so my time has come. I am so happy. Goodbye everyone. I am finally going to do it. I am so happy life is about to be over finally.
"Depression is just so damn brutal. Add on top being ugly, virgin, extreme social anxiety, lower iq with learning disabilities. Many internal issues. All for what? Why the fk am I suffering when I could just be dead. Seriously there is nothing for me here. People who tell me tRy neW tHiNgs do not get me. The fatigue is beyond awful. I am so scared of death. I hate religion for making me scared of hell. I think very awful things of christians now. I hate this existence. I am so alone , so dead inside and just gone. I am not even here Idk how much longer I can last"
I am not in the right mindset to have a job right now. I am 16 and have suicidal and homicidal thoughts everyday. I had crippling anxiety and now every second of my day its even worse because of my new job. I wake up anxious and I go to sleep anxious. Last time I asked my moms for anxiety pills she yelled at me and took all my stuff. Idk what to do. Please help me Please help me
"A week ago I was fine. Now all my friends hate my guts, and I cannot go outside because I have fuckhbg Covid. If the virus does not kill me then I sure as hell will do its job for it My life has gone downhill so fast"
"I was unable to cry for months. Idk what went wrong but I did not felt anything for months. Piled it up. I was not doing well, still does not feel good. I feel horrible but a little bit better. Tried my best to cry, forced it. Cried for like 10-15 mins. Eyes got pretty tired from it though. Physical weakness and the need to take a nap will help me to distract myself. I was planning a way to suicide and it is really hard to pick a method. Felt so stressed out when I saw it is not easy to end this pain. I cannot keep this anymore. That stress was there, used it. Brought some old memories back and cried it out. I guess some sleep will help to clear the rest. Whatever. it is just one day. Tomorrow will be worse. it is just one day. Crying helped"
The title....Even if there is no afterlife I still feel that my energy will be in the same place everyone is energy goes when we die The thought of an afterlife where I will be with all of those gone before me entices me to want to die
"I do not have a driver's license, nor a job, never had a relationship, I have no irl friends. How the fuck am I supposed to go on like this? I am not a bad person, I just have anxiety, am an introvert, and I am not really interested in the things most people like to do. Yet, I still feel like I should do them. I am so alone in my loserdom, my case is pretty rare. What does one do when one has no achievements at 20?"
I do not have any motivation to do anything i just want to lie down in bed till I die I am falling behind in my education and everything because of this but I just cannot get myself to do anything please help Help me please
I took a lot of some pillsIm scared I just overdosed
???? would my mom get a refund for school registration if i died
"I felt so much, that I started to feel nothing and here I am. Yay Idk wht is this"
"The titles a little sketchy, but what I am trying to say is I think the person your born loving the most on the planet rg your mum or so and so dies you choose your mum right? I was with this girl 6 years, and I miss her so much. I thought it would fade with time and fucking around, but I still miss her so much. We went through so much, 19 to 25 for me, 17 to 22 for her. Its hard to fathem how I feel about this girl.Unless you have had multiple serious relationships and one sticks out. Or maybe it is just the most recent/oldest. I just wish she knew how much I missed her and how sorry I am. In a sense this is another sad plea for help to one person on this rock that can make it better. But I truly do not deserve to know her, and it just makes me hate myself more. If you meet someone cool, do not fucking cheat, do not hurt them and do not lie to them. Fuck it you all. Anyone got some H? I think I actually loved her more than my mum."
"Today was supposed to be one of the last times I would be on Earth. Figured I would end it on a high note, and then in about like 5 days I would end it. Me and my four friends had visited a really nice China food place today. One of them even paid for my food. did not eat a lot because I figured ""what was the point?"". I had been pretty occupied with my thoughts. I feel selfish for that. A bit of time passed and we were walking to a hardware store specifically for rope, as I had to go there anyway. They were closed, and we sat down for a good 30 minutes. I decided to tell them how long I have been self harm free, 14 days and 16 hours at this point of writing this. I was not expecting it, but both of my friends hugged me. I have not hugged anyone for a long time, at least a couple years. I almost broke down. The most important people to me in my life, hugged me. I feel the happiest I have ever In such a long time. My best friend saved me"
I cannot stand that people see me. I am gross and ugly and I am sure they all notice and are disgusted by me. They are forced to see my side profile and my face ugly face. I cannot stand people even seeing that I existI do not like going out places with people because I feel bad for them to be seen with me I cannot stand going out in public because I do not want to be perceived
"All I want is to be loved genuinely and unconditionally. Why do I have to get better for them to finally love me? How do I tell them that there is nothing wrong with me, this is just who I am and I am so sorry. I wish I was anything or anyone else. I am sorry I would be so much more lovable if I were dead"
"Lol, you all should be glad ..."
"I am starting to feel like I am not the type of person who should be in a relationship. Romantic, friendly, any relationship. I am too pathetic. I always pounce at the opportunity to open up about my problems to people, I think I really crave someone who will always be there for me. But it always just ends up making things awkward and burdensome for others. I have no purpose in life. Maybe I should find a hobby or something. But even then. Hobbies would just help me get by day to day. In the grand scheme of things, I have no real purpose in life. I feel like I am just living, waiting to die. I am not extremely passionate towards anything. Ironically the only thing I really value is maybe my relationships with people, but I cannot hold even those together. So I just exist. But existing is getting tiring. I often feel like I want to ram my head into a wall, harder and harder, until I just - pop. I am so emotionally and physically drained from staying up every night just crying. I am so so so so tired. Just an empty rant"
"I got a job and I thought it was fun but they overwork me. They do not train me because they are busy. I just want to kill myself. People could say stuff like: well, start your own company.... you do not get it. I want out now. In the beginning I thought: well, I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they do not have time. Well, how did they thank me? By giving me more. I cannot handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming.... yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just do not see the need. Tf is this life? I want out. Hate this rat race"
Dammit another night laying in the dark scrolling reddit. Just want to sleeeeerp. cannot sleep
"I wish I had more positive interaction in my lifehow do I make more friends?I wish I had friends that were mental health friendly. I wish to have deep talks about depression and mental wellness. I wish I could have some compassion in my lifeThe way my life has wentsometimes I think that all I need is love. I need to be loved. I deserve it, right? Id like to think that I am worthy..but at the same time I feel like I cannot socialize correctly I consider myself sort of a weird guy, outside the box kind of person for sure. I think part of the reason I do not have successful or meaningful relationships is because of my weird personality. Do other people look at weird people and feel repulsed? What makes a person purely unattractive? Support Chat"
"I am for sure adding clonidine next month after i fully get up to 100mg on lamictal, but I am considering adding wellbutrin also. When i use things that are dopaminergic my mood goes right up to happy land, but i feel like i already have too much norepinepherine causing intense anxiety so I am hoping the clonidine would keep that in check Have any of you all used Lamictal with Wellbutrin? (And possibly clonidine)"
i tried last night. i woke up. guess i did not take enough pills. will not make that mistake again tonight. ill try over and over until i get it right. until I am a 15 yr old tragedy. i failed again last night.
Wow for days I have been worried about this and now that I have less then 24 hours I some how feel good more calm then I have been in a long time I am still scared but I am looking forward to it I will be leaving 2 notes 1 at my house and 1 on my body not saying goodbye to anyone in particular just bye because I the truth is I cut off everyone myself because I knew this time was coming and I did not want anyone to feel hurt because I was dead so for years I have worked on being as alone as possible I thought my parents abused me my mum would constantly tell me how dumb I was and I would burn in hell my dad was a angry person that beat my mum my earliest memory is of him hitting my mum. As my mum would put it years later I would not go to sleep without a beating in other words every night I got a beating for one reason or another. But this all was not true for my brothers at least that is what I believed my school life was bad I am dyslexic af and I used to be the small weak kid so I got bullied constantly really badly to the point teachers joined in on it as well so I got low grades and extra beatings until I got into college where I stopped getting bullied but I was 18 and never had a frienda year and half after that at the age of 20 my dad died that then my mum got depressed so I quit college and started to work 2 jobs to help support my mum and brothers a year and a half after that my mum died that was sad idk why I never liked her so instead of dealing with these emotions I did what my dad told me buried the emotions deep inside they used to boil up in the form of angerI went and got another 2 jobs I was on average sleeping 2-4 hours per night working non stop to support my brothers because that is what was expected of me I got engaged by the age of 23 through some arranged marriage my uncles and auntie set up but a week before the marriage my older brother told me he put me in a ton of debt(almost 100k) so my marriage got called offI had 2 in my account I was 25 by this point I tried to get back on the grind again but I could not my older brother left I could not bring myself to take him to court and over the years everyone told me my older brother was Fing me over even my younger brother was crying saying to me he is Fing you over I did not listen now I cannot look them in the eyes but now both of them have completed university i do not know what they do but they have jobs where you wear a suitI never gave any time to myself it was always about what was expected of me. Yeah I know sounds like a easy life but I feel burnt out always getting kicked down i did grow to be empathetic because nobody showed me any This is my life pathetic human that did nothing in his life and will die at 29 with nothing 24 hours to go my life
"It finally happened. The time to rejoice is now. Though it comes bittersweet, for it is short lived. I will fix this, I promise you. I will take away the pain. I finally found my answer"
"I wish I could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all I really want in this life is to just be loved. To have someone who can actually touch me, most times I associate that with romance. &amp;#x200B;But it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. The last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. The nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. How sad is it that I remember that after 3 months?!&amp;#x200B;That was the only physical contact I have had in nearly 3 YEARS and you wonder why I am constantly thinking about suicide? Is it not obvious?&amp;#x200B;I just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. But it is too much to ask and I know it is. I cannot do ""slow"". Not only have I been cut off from physical contact, I have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. &amp;#x200B;I do not know anyone where I live, I only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. Seeing as how I am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. &amp;#x200B;I frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because I am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. But if I do not cook, then we do not eat. If I do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. &amp;#x200B;Seems every day is just the same. Wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all I can muster. &amp;#x200B;This life has taken so much from me and all I have ever asked for was love. I have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love.&amp;#x200B;It was a nice ideal while it lasted, I suppose. Because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. You got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things.&amp;#x200B;And yet, even as I have grown older, I still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999% of it is completely and entirely useless. &amp;#x200B;Just basic stuff, you know? Like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a TV, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. You could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. &amp;#x200B;How ironic, I suppose. I try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, I have the least amount of people in my life as well. Who would have thought?&amp;#x200B;I try to change, I try to convince myself that I can change. But I am still stuck here, in this reality and I cannot lie to myself. I cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. &amp;#x200B;In honesty, I just do not want anything anymore. I want to want, but I do not want. The motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. I doubt much of anything ever could be.&amp;#x200B;I have tried EVERY SINGLE THING I could find. Breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, I am even currently in therapy, I am taking medication every day and I suppose that is a +1 for me. I am starting to kind of build a morning routine and I am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference!&amp;#x200B;I am still alone!! I am still useless!! I still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! I get the slightest hint of attention and I am like a fucking lost puppy! I will follow you off a fucking cliff!! &amp;#x200B;None of this is factually making anything about my life better. I am still miserable, I am still addicted to video games and YouTube and now Reddit has fallen in along the lines so I guess you all are just going to need to ban me. So I can do ""more constructive things"" with my life.&amp;#x200B;As if I want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! And it is just EVERYTHING!!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to do all of this and be this person that I am not and I have to do it all alone because I am so fucking worthless and I have made some real shit decisions in my life!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after I pour out the darkest parts of me. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to believe that things can get better when I am not seeing any real results from anything I am doing. My teeth are getting a bit whiter, so I guess that is the only real plus there.&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like I am going to explode and if that gets cut off... You can kiss all this progress goodbye. &amp;#x200B;I have been starved for most of my life. In one way or another, or multiple ways. But I cannot ask people to understand that. I have to be the one to change and I cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since I am so damn sensitive to attention because I am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but I am supposed to just be ok with it. &amp;#x200B;Yeah, it is ok. it is ok. I do not mind. Just go ahead and walk away, I do not mind. I do not mind. it is been awhile"
"Sometimes I feel like I may not be here for the rest of the time that I could. It frightens me, and I do not know how to accept it. In my darkest moments I accept it, but I am still afraid the reality of it, of myself. I try to focus on the fact that it was supposed to happen, or that nothing will matter afterwards, and try to ignore the invasion of death (how people root through your stuff and see your ugliest parts, or just completely forget about you because it hurts too much). ((TW)) I am learning how to you handle the fear of nearing death"
"sorry I am really close to just giving up everything.. all of the abuse I have endured this far makes me constantly wonder if i deserved it. I have always been a caring person and I have always been as nice as i can be but the world just constantly throws it back in my face. growing up with r\*pe, sexual and emotional abuse for years from my stepfather (and physical abuse from his romantic interests) alongside the murder? suicide? of my mom, i do not even know anymore what happened to herand that is hurting too. I am tired. i do not know if ""things will get better"" is true at all. I am 22 now and nothing has gotten better. all of the family that might have cared for me are dead now or i just do not talk to them because they have all of their own problems, not like a lot of them had ever gone through the effort to talk or help me anyways. its always been me, until foster care stepped in. cannot even mention the shittiness of that. my only escape used to be the internet, but at this point its less of an escape and just too much for me now toothere are little things in life i love, like my pets and my fiance and my friends, but i do not think i can make it any further in life. i do not want to drag them down with me while I am running out of money and literally deterriorating in front of my fiance, though i know I have already impacted his health. does not matter how much i try my best to be the best for him, I am just not good. the only ways i can function even just slightly is if I am high on anything. I have tried hard not to get into alcohol or do anything that might harm my body but i already have it pretty bad there anyways so i do not even know if its worth tryign to preserve myself at all. all i ever got told growing up from people who cared is that I am strong for living through what i did but it is too hard to get over those things when they impede my daily living constantly. i cannot go outside or i have terrible anxiety attacks, cannot work for the same reason. i can hardly buy groceries without either being in too much pain or suffering from these anxiety issues. needless to say the ptsd and insomnia make sleep almost impssible to come by and not at all refreshing. even just writing this reminds me that i just have too many problems and not a single solution for them has worked and I am tired of trying to fix things, using energy i do not have to do these things and try to live i just want to sleep and never wake up or maybe ill go on a walk and get hit by a car and die or something with my luck. I am too weakto kill myself but it will come to me eventually, or maybe ill get the strength to do so and finally just end my pain and complaining its hard"
(Every other side I asked the question I got a massage to do not ask this questions on there page) What is the Faste suicide method
i will not be here tomorrow i have no reason to keep going
"disclaimer: i do not take antidepressants and i do not think ever will. i do not want to intermingle any ssri, snri or others alike with my current medication, adderall, due to concomitant risk factors.i feel like I am in a state of inertia i want to strive far and make progress in many different fields, and I am confident, but i do not take the steps to further reach my goals.I am 19 years old. just 12 months ago, i got my first job at petco. the experience was great i can proudly say i had a strong beneficial impact on both my peers and the people id meet on a daily basis. i was a very bubbly kid, a yes-man with a smiling face, willingness to see each of my peers have a better day, and loved to perform beyond expectations.unfortunately, the store ended up losing people, and those that remained turned lax. i eventually alternated from animal care and occasional stock-work to full-time at the register alone eight hours a day. this schedule quickly turned me into a robot, marred my social enjoyment, and stressed me out. what made matters worse is that my boss wanted me to force customers to sign up for our rewards program i would always ask them, list the positive facets and whatnot, but there would always be people that just wanted to get there stuff and book it, and a lot that would get angry at me. i did not force people because i did not want to look more like an advertisement drone. the stress impacted my respiration, heart rate, caffeine consumption and sleep. to keep from saying much more of it, i disappeared early into may without notice.since i quit, I have been playing the same video game (overwatch yeah i know) for at least 6 hours a day, sometimes up to 12. i love it, and i find myself most content when i play it, primarily because I am really good at it. after about a month of routinely doing this, i started to think about how i have even less of a life than i did when i was practically a vapid husk at petco.my room is big. adjunct bathroom and everything. extremely comfy bed, relaxing strip-lights, tranquil fan breezes... every person that has stepped foot in here has loved it. maybe its too comfy.my med stack is stupid-big. its mostly composed of nootropics and micronutrient supplements:- dextroamphetamine / amp. salts (adderall)- 5-htp- st. johns wort- ashwagandha- l-tyrosine- n-acetyl cysteine- sarcosine- vitamins b6, b12 and d3- ginkgo biloba- omega-3- magnesium cl. hexahydrate (topical)- l-theanine &amp; gaba- calcium carbonate (tums)my diet is awful. i eat pizza, pb&amp;j and fast food. i wish i ate fish and nutrient-rich foods, i really do. there is just something in me that tells me i will never eat it.i got my permit when i was 16. i tried driving back then, but eventually just stopped wanting to sometime before i turned 18. I am just scared to.i want to spend time with my friends and enjoy it, but after an hour of doing so i often end up wanting to isolate and tackle boring statistics or learn about some ridiculous topic just to do something.i wanted to go to college for pharmacology. my knowledge on the subject broadens every day, and i employ it to help people as much as i can and its worked.i used to listen to music. now i skip 80% of the tracks in my playlist. i used to feel butterflies within me when i spent time with my girlfriend, but even though i love her with every last fiber of my being, it does not feel the same.i have a novel presently with ~50k words. i love my literary tongue, and i would love to pursue it, but i just do not.all i do is play that one video game and read.is anybody else amid an inertia like this? any kind of comment would make me feel good. I am not sad nor 'feel' depressed at all, but I am definitely plagued with apathy, and know that I am going no where in life. what am i missing?"
"I have only been working at this place for a week and a half, but during and after work I am wanting to hang myself or jump off the nearest overpass. I was struggling with this same issue while i was in the Army. I mostly has to do with pass trauma and my ADHD, i had meds but since i tried to over dose on them they took them away and threw any i had left away. I have was enrolled in a psych ward over in Germany and it was a pretty good experience to take my mind off things. But now that I am back in the states I am worried on how the hospitals over here are like. The just seem to be recurring no matter what i do, I have been trying since i was 7 but i never really stopped. While i was overseas i was diagnosed with Major Depression and ADHD and have not really found a way to handle it besides dying. Anyways, i was told to resign from the job but ill still get my paycheck, so i will not have to worry about bills for a little bit till i find another job.P.S. if anyone knows a less stressful job that i could look into that would be much appreciated. Just tried hanging myself at work today"
If everyone could treat each other like actual living souls and not use other people as a way to get something they want if people cared more about someone is progress and who they are today and not gaslight them from who they were this whole worlds system would fall apart and we could all have a new society not a perfect one but one where we take peoples emotions seriously and get to know peoples hearts sorry for horrible grammar but I need to rant Life does not have to be like this
"* **So I was playing a Team Fortress 2 map on casual, I have been playing this game for about 5 years and I still suck at the game at times and sometimes do to my family's internet and my crappy intel laptop, I would lag. I saw videos of people telling their problems on here so I thought I should give it a try. I am a 17 year old guy doing my last year of high school, I have autism and I prefer to be treated like a normal person and to get not pity for having autism. But what happened was that this guy who ill keep anonymous. He was saying I was bad and just being harsh about it giving me nothing but destructive criticism.** &amp;#x200B;* **I use this game as a coping mechanism and it works a lot. I just need some support and motivation right now and would appreciate not looking this guy up because I already reported him for abusing the in game kick system and harassment.** I played Team Fortress 2 &amp; met a harsh guy."
"I am still unsure about whether or not to kill myself but at least I have prepared this for when/if my family find out. I plan on visiting the train station soon, now let us see if I am brave enough to jump I have written my suicide note"
"Why does everything feel so hard? It feels hard to love, to hate, to do, to not do.. what is the point of struggling through friendships, romance, family, work, leisure? there is no alternative everything is just hard and were here to feel it. Just depressing. Our depressing reality"
"Every fucking time I have got an episode I try to excuse my actions in the most stupid of ways, which only makes the episode wost and broadens the problem by me worrying to goddam much about it. I am not going to kill myself but I need a way out, talking is not going to work because the only I can talk to about this just is weird to talk about, maily because she is the one I excused myself to in the most stupid of eays, by just saying ""sorry if I am to much"". I just fucking cannot. I do not fucking know anymore"
i feel like my time is coming to an end honestlygetting closer and closer time is up
"I am angry and crying. I hurt. But idk if its right to feel hurt. It makes me feel worse that I feel bad for myself. I should not. I want to tell someone everything but I cannot, because its wrong. I just want to die. Right now. If there was a god he would kill me for the good of the world and to end my suffering. I was not made for this world. I do not belong here. Crying"
"I am sorry if that sounds horribly insensitive to people with who are terminally ill, and I know there a lot of people who are who also suffer from depression. And I would gladly give my life to someone who does want to be here if it meant saving theirs. But at least if I did have some disease that I knew would kill me then I would have an expiration date. 80 years is a long time to suffer. I hope something or someone kills me before then, other than me. I would rather have a terminal illness than depression"
"I am not sure if this is the right place to post it but summer started recently and my and 2 of my friends go, i have type one diabetes and keratosis pilaris , when we go they usually wear shorts and a tshirt but i feel uncomfortable wearing shirts as it leaves my arms out and I am insecure about those bu having keratosis pilaris all over my body so when we go i usually wear a long sleeve top in and joggers in 30 degree weather, i feel like they fuel it more, they know ik insecure about my KP and t1d but they use it against me when we have the little arguments i usually just shut up after that, they were friends together before i joined them and i really do not have anyone else to go too if i do retaliate when they go too far with the jokes i have told them so many times i do not want to hear it but they always keep it, they do not argue with eachother it always feels like they gang up on me on EVERYTHING , everything it feels like I am restricted i. What i wear since if my FRIENDS are saying this stuff about me and making me feel like shit ahout it then what are strangers going to say, i do not know what to do and its stopping me fron seeing them as much, also in 15 Hiding my insecurities"
"Its not about me, I do not feel at all suicidal but please try and help me. Works stressing their mother out, she has 12h shifts with only 1 and a half hour long breaks and she cannot get another job because of covid, its getting to her too much and she told my friend ""I cannot take it anymore"". What can I do to help both my friend and her mother? My friend is terrified and does not want to tell anyone else incase she is wrong and make things worse for her mother. What can I do to help, what advice can I give, what help can I send? My friends thinks her mother is suicidal and I do not know what to do."
"This mountain is where I found quite a large spot. A ton of height and just solid concrete at the bottom as it was by a parking lot. I found this spot years ago and think about it when I think about killing myself. Today I went to go find it. Not to end it all. Just to see it and I guess think. But I could not find it. There was a whole bunch of trees, no wya its gone but I do not know that was my escape plan for August. The only other idea I have is death by train but I I do not know I went to a mountain today"
i am supposed to be doing better but thoughts of ending my life still plague my everyday existence. i truly believe that my death would relieve so many people of burden and immense potential pain. how do i stop imagining this escape and stop feeling this way? how do you deal with suicidal ideations?
"I have plans for my future. I am happy about them, excited even. I am going to start college in a year or two. I have every good thing right at my doorstep tbh, but I woke up today with a blue body I do not know how else to put it. Its been a few days that I have been feeling this day, but today was a very prominent day when I felt blue, almost as if my veins and arteries are carrying a liquid called depression. Every step felt heavy. I had my blood tests done a few hours ago, and honestly, a part of me almost expected blue liquid to come out. Or black, maybe. I guess it was a moment of stupid imagination, but I felt so empty and hollow that it felt alien to expect my body would react in a humanly way. All my plans are very competitive, and yes, I am incredibly optimistic about my future goals. But somewhere at the back of my head, I have my suicide planned out. How When Where My suicide note Its just like another option for me if my future plans do not become something that I want. My depression is spiralling into suicide as a resort to failed future plans"
"I wish I had the strength to try anymore. I have nothing and no one, and my cries for help go unanswered (and even fucking downvoted). I wish I never fucking tried for so long, that I would given up years ago rather than wasting 15 years hoping life would get better, thinking if I just fucking tried hard enough, was kind to others and took care of those I loved, apply to any job I can, life could be better. I could be better. *What a fucking joke.* 15 years of fucking mental and physical pain, 15 years of struggling every fucking day, 15 years of ignoring the part of my head that tells me everyone would be happier if I died... just fuck it all. My life is meaningless and beyond worthless. Fuck it. Nothing left for me"
"He was murdered by his friends who invited him out to dinner only to kill him in a brutal slow way, while he was all alone with them at night. Everyone knew they did it, but they had to be released because they could not get enough evidence. The kid who died was innocent and had a gf. It happened in the winter, in a very tiny, stormy seaside town. This kid's death only got a physical newspaper snippet or two, nothing more. No online articles or any records or anything, it is like he was just forgotten about with the exception of a handful of people who remember reading those articles in the printed newspaper shortly after the murder happened. Or the people who worked with him and claimed to have seen his ghost wandering around.. that is it. It was almost a decade ago this happened. Is it normal that the death of a teenager who was murdered by his friends long ago keeps making me very depressed?"
"Anyone find cycling phenylalanine and 5htp daily is a great way to remove depression? My depression has recently been bad and libido too. I find phenylalanine can really deliver motivation and a good feeling, however it can easily become unbalanced if not mixed with 5htp. It has been a while since I did this, but today feel reallly motivated after dl-phenylalanine, will go up to at least 2,000mg and then later tonight will have 5htp if feel the need. Phenylalanine and 5htp - great for depression?"
"I do not know how to deal with all of them. Medication (citalopram) did not help and it made me dizzy so I quit. Its been almost 3 years since my burnout started and I had to quit college and my job but I am still showing no signs of recovery. Its driving me nuts.In 2017/2018 I worked so hard to lose weight (75 lbs) and succeeded. Now I gained more back (like 80 lbs) then I lost and my therapists any told me that there is nothing I can do about that at the moment. But I have already been waiting 2 years and 8 months. I am at my wits end.I am slowly seeing myself gaining more and more weight which is absolutely ruining my mental and physical health. I am too afraid to go outside in daylight because I am scared people I know will see I gained all of the weight back. Especially the people who used to bully me. My therapist recommended focusing only walking 15 minutes at night but that is already really tiring for me. It makes me really dizzy and tired. I only succeeded in doing it for one week recently I have been thinking I do not want to live anymore so often and its scaring me. I feel like I am out of options. Depression, Anxiety, Autism, Weight gain and a Burnout"
"I am pretty sure that I will do it soon, but I need a way where my family can see my body fully when I am gone. I hate myself so much I live in a lie. I do not know if I am bi or gay and I feel like nothing. I am afraid to live and I will not ever love myself so why keep continuing. what is the easiest way to kill myself?"
"Well, I am about to start sophomore year of high school and everything should be coming up roses for me. Freshman year sucked with a depressive episode in the middle of it, but that is in the past, right?Well, everything *is* great on the surface, at least. I have a large circle of great friends, an amazing and beautiful girlfriend, I get good grades, and have the chance to finally play school baseball this year. I am sure I seem happy, and I feel like I should be; but I am just not.I am an anxious fucking mess below the surface, and honestly I think its starting to show. I am constantly paranoid that people secretly hate me for no reason. I am starting I have trouble sleeping again, and my panic attacks are coming back. My last sibling (at least left at home) leaves for college in a few weeks, school starts and I have not ever been into this building, my anxiety is already building about baseball next spring.I do not want to go back to therapy, and I *really* do not want to get diagnosed with anxiety because both my sisters are. Whenever I went to therapy I was terrified to stop playing the act of my regular, confident self. Maybe I just have trust issues because I do not tell anyone about my issues, not even my girlfriend or best friends. I hate it but I just cannot.I cannot do this again, man. what is wrong with me? my life seems good!"
"I cannot cope with the guilt of chasing my first love away when I was experiencing a PTSD Episode I cannot cope with my second love telling me he only loved the good side and that I looked emotionless all the time with a lifeless look in my eyesI cannot cope with my trauma, the memories are too much and it is been haunting me for yearsI've tried many times to kill myself but hopefully this time it works it is all too much to handle and I am sick of hanging on"
i wish i could at least loose my memory so things would not hurt so much. it hurts
"I do not fk know what I will type at this point but i rewrote my notes from last december end deleted some names and parts dedecated to my ""friends"". I tried to talk but got ignored and made fun of so I turned to alcohol as my confort. Friends that I used to vent to just ignored me for a couple of months and it became to much. This does not make much sense but I wanted to say something but I just cannot for some reason anyway I am going to leave it so yeahUhm Bye Just wrote my notes again"
"I have been in therapy and I feel so much better. it is been a year since the last time I thought about ending my life, I have done so much work and I still have to, but I feel really proud of myself. It gets better, I promise!! I no longer want to kill myself"
"This is how my day goes I wake up find things to do to distract me from bad thoughts or I am sleeping as a form of escaping my thoughts but the period where I actually try to sleep and have no distractions and I am thinking, my thoughts always make me feel like I am the worst person alive Distraction"
Ill be going for an intake on Monday. The groups will be all through zoom because of the pandemic still. I am not sure what to expect or if it will even help me with my depression and anxiety. Just looking to see if anyone has been in one and if it helped. Has anyone entered a partial hospitalization program?
"I am first generation. My parents stayed together because of religious reasons, but there was a lot of emotional and physical abuse. Typical I think a lot of first gen suffer like this. Now as an adult I am having trouble being emotionally stable, I feel helpless at these feelings, and depression takes over. I know I cannot change the past, but now I have difficulties making adult friends, because I was so limited, I was not allowed to have friends over, My parents fought with family so even family connection was limited. My dad was always angry if I came out of my room he was yelling at how useless I was, so now I realize Idk how to be with people. People think I am so weird. I am so tiered of having such a hard time at being human, I crave emotional connection and I do not have it. I used to think of everything so religiously because that was embedded into me, now I am always doubting if god exist and if life is pointless. Its hard to stay positive, idk what to do with my life and if I do not do anything doctorly I am a failure to my parents. What is up with foreign parents wanting all their kids to be doctors? I started therapy its been 3 sessions and right away she wanted to put me on antidepressants, and I tried it, I had the worst idk what to call it, I started taking the anti depressants and I am like, why is life? I should just die. And I was sleepy all the time, so I stopped, I do not want anti depressants I need something and idk what. This is a desperate late night vent, thanks for reading. I needed a venting source, here I am"
"Started volunteering at a local animal shelter. I feel better, not happier. I still really hate myself, but I think I can push forward. I want to start painting and drawing to express myself, I know I'l start eventually. Days just blend in"
"I think I am going to kill myself tonightI've been living with mental issues since about middle school. Mainly, being depressed and having a lot of issues with who I am/how I look. The only time that I started accepting myself was when I was in a relationship and had someone there to remind me that at least they thought I was attractive, and that was all that mattered. However, my insecurities eventually got the best of me and I became toxic and jealous, which led to the end of the relationship several months ago.I deserved that, and she deserved better. I know that I hurt her a lot, and I have trouble living with that. It also reduces my self image further, to where I have trouble living with myself in general. I think I was incredibly lucky to have been in a relationship with someone like that, and I do not think it will happen again. I do not want it to happen again, because I know it would end the same way. I have been in therapy and help groups since the break up trying to deal with myself and be a better person, but I have not noticed any improvement.I think at this point I am just a burden and holding the people around me back. I am always bringing up my issues and wanting to deal with them, but it is just at a point now where no one wants to see me anymore because of that. I am also scared of them seeing that toxic part of me that I am having trouble changing and leaving me.I feel bad that people will be hurt by this, but I hope that they will be able to move on quickly. Someone always loses in a fight"
"I have been having breakdowns/tantrums over the past year. One last August, another one last November, one last May, and just earlier this week. My aunt (who I have never had a good relationship with) says I am having breakdowns habitually at this point and that I am taking advantage of my family. What she meant by habitually is that I am doing this on purpose/just to get what I think I want. She also says that I think the world revovles around me and that I need to get a grip. I do not even know what to think, because what she is saying is true. I need to get a grip since I feel like I have just been floating for so long now, and whenever I get hit with reality now and then I have a breakdown. I am just feeling so much hate and anger within myself and I am just taking it out on my family. I want this all to end. I am a fucking failure haha My family does not take me seriously anymore"
"I have entered what I would probably characterize as the darkest period of my life so far. I am in a job I despise, and I recently started therapy, which has overall been a net positive, but it is also forced me to take a long and hard look at many personal traits of my own that need a A LOT of work. I am realizing I do not have a strong sense of personal identity and that I have a much lengthier and more problematic track record of behaving in toxic and manipulative ways. All-in-all: my opinion of myself is quickly rocketing into the dirt and I am in the midst of the most intense identity crisis I have ever experienced.All of this and a slew of other unpleasant factors have left me feeling like I am heading right for a potentially explosive breakdown. Like, I am about to get married and I love my fiance very much, but making a lifelong commitment like that to another human being when I myself feel like I have no clue who I am, what my values and passions are, or where I am heading in life scares the shit out of me. I have also recently began indulging some self-harm impulses (which are relatively minor and not life-threatening or scarring) for the first time in over a decade which feels like such an enormous step backwards for me. I feel like a rubber band stretched to the brink of snapping and some unknown combination of time and/or additional tension will inevitably make me snap. I do not know what to do about it, because the more I think about the state I am in, the more I feel like I am spiraling out of control. But I also feel like I cannot NOT think about it because ignoring and repressing my problems and my mistakes is how I ended up here in the first place. The worst part is that, even though I can feel the meltdown coming, I feel powerless to stop it. Which is kind of how I would sum up my current crisis: a complete loss of control over my life and the direction it is going in.Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If so, any tips on how to deal with yourself or at least keep yourself from hurting others while your life is unravelling? Even if not, I appreciate having the space to vent. (For the record: I am not presently concerned I am going to kill myself, and I am not worried I am at risk of physically hurting others. But I am worried I am at risk of burning all of my bridges and tanking all my personal and professional relationships into the ground and causing a lot of emotional damage to myself and others on the way.) What do you do when you feel yourself beginning to unravel? Can I at least mitigate the damage my impending breakdown could because others?"
"Hello,Decided to keep myself occupied by working 75 hour shifts at my job &amp; get my money up. Been putting my debt aside for awhile now &amp; I have come to terms that I cannot let it go on like this. Baby steps for me to become healthy, I need to be financially free. My main goal in life is to be free. I do not want to feel chained, I do not want to feel like I have any ties with this planet, &amp; to do so I really need to discipline myself, but before that I need to play catch up. So this is what I am on, hoping to feel better after I get this debt out the way. Hope everyone out here reading is trying as well. Were not alone. Day #4 07/23/2021 6:41PM CST"
"Hi there. I am 17 (18 by the end of the year) and needing to go on antidepressants. I have been struggling with depression + severe suicidal thoughts since I was 12, among other mental illnesses, and I finally have the motivation to seek help. Does anyone know where I start? Can I just call my GP and set up an appointment? I went through camhs when I was 13-14, but they were beyond useless.Any help is appreciated. Thanks. Accessing antidepressants in the UK"
"Hey guys,I have been very recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been struggling with problems for around 1.5 year, and only now it came to light that it is psychologically, not physical. With my state worsening severely in last 2-3 months, I have noticed something. When I get the attack, I have problems with speech, I talk slowly, struggle with saying/pronouncing certain words/letters. Can anxiety/depression because this during the attack? I have found that this happens to people with a stroke, but I have not had a stroke, all medial tests were negative. Thank you all for any kind of advice, if not allowed, I will delete this post. Can depression/anxiety attack because this?"

I have terminal cancer. I do not know how long I have left to live but every day I just feel like I want to end it. I hate watching my husband suffer as he cares for me. I hate my young children seeing me go through so much pain. I feel so depressed all the time and am exhausted from fighting. Suicidal thoughts with terminal cancer
"I am tired of putting up a fake smile, fake laugh and shit. I think I am depressed, like I have a lot of self-hatred, suicidal thoughts almost everyday. it is so fucking hard to concentrate on studies. My phone is my only escape. I do not know what the fuck to do now. I do not know if I am depressed or am I just acting like and idiot. I do not know what the fuck I am going to do now."
"every day i constantly am searching for things to distract myself, anything, from the constant feeling of guilt for not killing myself. i feel like a constant burden and disappointment to everyone i know and I am losing my mind. i have to hide that I am nonbinary and suicidal to everyone in my life and its fucking killing me inside my boyfriend tries to help but i cannot tell him what I am thinking because he might blame himself or try to help me on his own and i do not want to put that burden on him. i just want to die I am tired of the constant guilt and the thought of jumping out of every moving car I am in or jumping from the nearest windows to me every fucking day i cannot do this"
Nothing i can do will fix that. I am never going to be enough
"If I would overcome my fears and stepout of my comfort zone and finally go to therapy then what? What should I tell them? That I do drugs? That I earn money illegally? (I do not sell drugs) What are they going to do? Lock me in the psychatry or prison? Or even both??? And what should I say what my next move is? To be honest my next move is not going to university or doing something normal its doing more drugs, harder drugs to escape reality. I cannot do this anymore I did not do drugs for 3 days and I am beyond miserable Going to therapy and saying what?"
"I am 17 (m) and I feel like my brain is dying. I struggle to remember anything and it feels like I cannot even think properly, like fog has taken over my brain. Every day feels the same and nothing seems to get better no matter how hard I try. That last 6 months I have been trying so fucking hard to do everything right, I have got myself a job, been actively spending time with friends and gotten myself into shape but I still feel as bad as I did before. People say your childhood &amp; school years are best part of my life but I have been depressed ever since I can remember. I just do not know what to do anymore, nothing that used to bring me happiness does anymore. I Feel So Cold"
"I am tired. i want to just sit down and cry but i feel so embarrassed about it. i want to scream and yell but I do not have the energy. i feel so helpless.everything i have is so fucking crappy it is depressing. my laptop was the one thing i had and now it is broke. i do not have a single cent. I am going to have to do a job for a couple of months to be able to get it fixed. so i have that to look forward to.i have a phone but not only is its headphone jack busted, but recently my headphones broke as well. my parents will never give me money because we are too busy just trying to survive. nothing i have works any more.my laptop was one way i could zone out of my parents reach. now it does not work. i try to do other stuff but I cannot. i used to put on some music and i would just lay down and chill if i ever felt sad. i cannot do thta anymore and it frustrates me More than anything. i want to sit down a d cry. i used to listen to music to get in touch with my feelings. i cannot even do that anymore.i want.this misery to end. for the first time in my life, i have actually begun to lose faith in god. I do not know what is happening to me. I am angry and frustrated and it makes me want to cry."
I am trying to find something that would make my death less sufferable. Ket and a lot of benzos seems not bad. Thoughts? Is ketamine and benzo combo a peaceful death?
"I am so exhausted...Tired and broken. I am not anything to anybody anymore and everything is my fault. I did it to myself because I have always hated myself for being less than. I am not a good person, son, brother etc...I just do not see a reason for living much longer. I try to distract myself with porn and video games and the internet in general but its not working. I want to die. I NEED to die... I am watching myself age and sink further into utter ruin. I do not have a reason to live... The only thing holding me back is time... I want to die outside in the cold. I figure the least I could do is not kill myself in my mothers attic and have the nosy neighbors witness my body being carried out. Tired."
